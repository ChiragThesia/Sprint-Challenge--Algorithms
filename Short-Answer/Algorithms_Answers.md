## Exercise I

a) RTC for this O(n) because of the each input is n* n so after n iteration of input. it will be equal to n*(n*n) which is what the while loop is doing. 


b)RTC is O(nlog(n)). This is due to the nested while loop in the for loop. For loop will run n times on the input and while loop will run logn times on the input. 


c) RTC is O(n)recursive function and it calls it self n times. when it his the base case, the function goes through it self.  It adds 2 to the return value and runs through it self n times, and since adding 2 is a constant operation and it is done n times then the RTC is O(n)
